    <p>in the beggining of the story, setting off the main events. after the attack and rebuilding of his arcade,</p>
    <p>nobody returned due to fear of another attack. So cubon, on the verge of bankruptcy and tired, goes down</p>
    <p>and discovers where the person had come from: a secret passage. he ends up dragging his girfriend,</p>
    <p>cubette, down there for revenge. he later finds out that his arcade was a target by the underground</p>
    <p>dictator, king cubit. the reason his arcade was blown up was becuase his subjects could escape his underground</p>
    <p>kingdom through it. And so, cubon's journey to free everyone from the evil king begins...</p>
