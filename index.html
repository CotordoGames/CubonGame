    <p>in the beggining of the story, setting off the main events.<br> after the attack and rebuilding of his arcade,</p>
    <p>nobody returned due to fear of another attack. So cubon, on the verge<br> of bankruptcy and tired, goes down</p>
    <p>and discovers where the person had come from: a secret passage.<br> he ends up dragging his girfriend,</p>
    <p>cubette, down there for revenge. he later finds out that his arcade was<br> a target by the underground dictator</p>
    <p>, king cubit. the reason his arcade was blown up was becuase his subjects could escape his underground</p>
